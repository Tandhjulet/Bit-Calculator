Using bitwise operations instead of just directly multiplying, dividing, etc., is in no way faster. It's actually much slower.
This project was made purely for educational purposes, to help me get a better understanding of bitwise operations.

TODO:
- floating point numbers
- better support for negative numbers
- paranthesis
